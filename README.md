# AoC2016

Repository to hold my solutions to the advent of code 2016, might do a small write up at the end or something :)

Folders contain the inputs, and a `main.js` corresponding to part 1 of the problem, and `main2.js` corresponding to part 2.
If there is only one then it was trivial to include both solutions in one file.
